I am a first year CS Master's student at University of Wisconsin, Madison. My research interest lies broadly in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

Prior to this, I worked in the Multimedia and Algorithms team in Samsung Semiconductor India Research where I contributed to the Dense Optical Flow engine and the Spatio-temporal Noise Reduction engine for the image post processing pipeline in Exynos SoC.

Before that, I completed my Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay. For my masters thesis, I was supervised by [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/) where I worked on building efficient hardware accelerator for convolutional neural network.
